Problem1.py:
    All packages needed are imported at the begining of the code.
    data file need to be in the Week02 repository for it to be succesfully loaded
    the code can be ran as a file and will print out the OLS result and an array showing differences betwen OLS and Multivariant normal(which is an empty array)

Problem2.py:
    All packages needed are imported at the begining of the code.
    data file need to be in the Week02 repository for it to be succesfully loaded
    the output would be an OLS result table and a summary of the three different models.
    graphs generated would be stored in the Week02 repository
